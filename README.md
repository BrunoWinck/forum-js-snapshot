Coursera Forums JS Snapshot
=========

This is a snapshot of the frontend code that powers the new Coursera forums, a single-page Backbone web app. This snapshot includes Backbone models, views, Jade templates, Stylus styles, and Mocha/Chai tests. You can read more about the forum code in this technical blog post.

What is a snapshot?
-----------
We want to share this code publicly so that we can refer to it from talks/posts and so that we can share our approach to this particular problem in case others have a similar problem (or if they have suggestions for how we can improve our approach, of course). However, we do not feel comfortable sharing the server-side code for security reasons, and we do not have the engineering resources to take on the burden of maintenance of a separate code repository. As such, this codebase is non-functional and incomplete. However, we hope that it is still useful to you.
